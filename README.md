# Despawn Engine

## Open-source voxel game engine
[Despawn Engine](https://godotengine.org) is planned to be a one-stop shop for developers, with flexibility, high-performance, and freedom to sell games without annoying restrictions.

Focused on block-based, grid-aligned worlds, including fully destructible and placeable terrain.

Built in Rust + Vulkano to take advantage of modern hardware.

## License soon
Probably going to have a Godot-esque license. No real need to make money from this engine itself outside of potential donations, and the current contributors are more focused on wanting to make money from our own games made with the engine. License isn't written up yet but I'm thinking, anyone can fork the engine and make modifications, obviously nobody can steal the Despawn Engine name so it remains an up to date hub, and there are 0 restrictions on the games people make with the engine.

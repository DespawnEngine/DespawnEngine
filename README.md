# DespawnEngine
Open-source voxel game engine. Planned to be a one-stop shop for developers, with flexibility, high-performance, and freedom to sell games without annoying restrictions.

Focused on block-based, grid-aligned worlds, including fully destructible and placeable terrain.

Built in Rust + Vulkano to take advantage of modern hardware.
